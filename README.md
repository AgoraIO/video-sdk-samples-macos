# Video SDK for macOS code examples

Use the contents in this repo to compare the following ways of presenting runnable code examples in an open source 
repository. In all examples, the code corresponds to a page in the Agora developer documentation. 

Each folder contains the runnable code explained in the documentation. 

Advantages are that we supply runnable code where the UI is abstracted so we concentrate more clearly on Agora
    SDK. This means the docs become much shorter and simpler. Possible disadvantage is that we have to write the
    code for the project. TBH, we already have the code, we are just putting it in a better format for learning.
